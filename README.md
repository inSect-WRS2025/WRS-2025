# World Robot Summit 2025 Harsh Environment F-REI Challenge, Simulation Disaster Challenge Official GitHub

## Overview
The competition at the tournament is set up with the scenario of “Information gathering and emergency response in a harsh environment, assuming a plant disaster".

## Task（Regularly update）
- We currently have built a simulation environment that takes into account the tasks required for disaster response.
- We are going to upload a simplified course that will allow you to perform each task in the future.

### Ramp
<img width="33%" src="./fig/ramp.png">

- The UGV needs to go up and down the ramp.<br>
- The UGV needs to cross the ramp.

### Catwalk
<img width="33%" src="./fig/catwalk.png">

- The UGV needs to pass through the catwalk (narrow aisle).

### Duct
<img width="33%" src="./fig/duct.png">

- The UAV enters through the duct and inspects the inside of the tank. (If there is air flow, etc., the robot close the valve first.)

### Stairs
<img width="33%" src="./fig/stairs.png">

- The UGV needs to go up and down the stairs.

### Meter
<img width="33%" src="./fig/meter.png">

- The robot needs to read the value shown on the meter.

### QR code
<img width="33%" src="./fig/qr.png">

- You explore the entire area and search for the QR codes as possible. The QR codes are inside the tubes.
  - The robot needs to read them.

### Switch
<img width="33%" src="./fig/switch.png">

- The robot needs to press the specified switch.

### Valve, Lever
<img width="33%" src="./fig/valve.png">

- The UGV needs to turn the valves and levers.
  - You can stop the fluid that is leaking by turning the valve or lever.
  - The value on the meter may change by turning the valve or lever.

### Door
<img width="33%" src="./fig/door.png">

- The robot needs to open the door and enter the interior.

### Fire extinguishing work
#### Step 1:
<img width="33%" src="./fig/fire1.png">

- The robot needs to open the fire extinguisher door and extract the hose.

#### Step 2:
<img width="33%" src="./fig/fire2.png">

- The robot needs to extract the nozzle and connect the nozzle and hose.

#### Step 3:
<img width="33%" src="./fig/fire3.png">

- The robot needs to open the valve inside the fire extinguishing equipment.

#### Step 4:
<img width="33%" src="./fig/fire4.png">

- The robot needs to pull the nozzle lever to extinguish the fire.

# World Robot Summit 2025 Harsh Environment F-REI Challenge, Simulation Disaster Challenge Official GitHub

## Overview
The competition at the tournament is set up with the scenario of “Information gathering and emergency response in a harsh environment, assuming a plant disaster".

## Task（Regularly update）
- We currently have built a simulation environment that takes into account the tasks required for disaster response.
- We are going to upload a simplified course that will allow you to perform each task in the future.

### Ramp
<img width="50%" src="./fig/ramp.png">
- The UGV needs to go up and down the ramp.<br>
- The UGV needs to cross the ramp.

### Catwalk
<img width="50%" src="./fig/catwalk.png">
- The UGV needs to pass through the catwalk (narrow aisle).

### Duct
<img width="50%" src="./fig/duct.png">
- The UAV enters through the duct and inspects the inside of the tank. (If there is air flow, etc., the robot close the valve first.)

### Stairs
<img width="50%" src="./fig/stairs.png">
- The UGV needs to go up and down the stairs.

### Meter
<img width="50%" src="./fig/meter.png">
- The robot needs to read the value shown on the meter.

### Switch
<img width="50%" src="./fig/switch.png">
- The robot needs to press the specified switch.

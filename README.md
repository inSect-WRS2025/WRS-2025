# World Robot Summit 2025 Harsh Environment F-REI Challenge, Simulation Disaster Challenge Official GitHub

## Overview
The competition at the tournament is set up with the scenario of “Information gathering and emergency response in a harsh environment, assuming a plant disaster".

## Task（Regularly update）
- We currently have built a simulation environment that takes into account the tasks required for disaster response.
- We are going to upload a simplified course that will allow you to perform each task in the future.

### Stairs

- The robot needs to go up and down the stairs.

### Duct

- The UAV enters through the duct and inspects the inside of the tank. (If there is air flow, etc., the robot close the valve first.)
